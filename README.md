# Controlled RAG + Agent Execution System

A production-style AI backend where LLMs act as planners, while execution,
permissions, and cost are strictly controlled by the system.

## Core Features
- Explicit RAG (no implicit hallucination)
- LangGraph-based planning
- Deterministic execution engine
- Tool permission enforcement
- Token & cost control
- Full audit logging

## Status
Core system complete. Detailed documentation coming soon.
